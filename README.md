# sparta-ruby-calculator

## Brief

Your task is to write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.
* First you will need to ask the user for which calculator they want to use
* Then you will need to ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
* Then you need to work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.

### What I delivered
Completed the advanced, basic, and BMI calculator.

### What went well
Generally understood how to do what I wanted to do and I found this homework quite good. Calculator works fine.

### What could have gone better
I don't really understand how to use functions in ruby so would like to go over that and I think my code could be tidier.
